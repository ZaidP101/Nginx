# URL Shortener\n\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n## Description\n\nThis is a full-stack URL shortener application that allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. The application consists of a React-based frontend (located in the `UrlShortner` directory) and a Node.js/Express backend (located in the `server` directory). The backend provides an API for creating and redirecting shortened URLs. The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the API.\n\nThis project leverages MongoDB for database storage, allowing for persistent URL mapping between original and shortened URLs. The front-end includes QR code generation for shortened links, providing convenient access for mobile users.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **URL Shortening:** Converts long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.\n*   **Custom Short URLs (Potential):**  (This needs to be verified.  If implemented, update this.) Allows users to specify custom short URLs.\n*   **URL Redirection:** Redirects users to the original URL when they visit the shortened URL.\n*   **QR Code Generation:** Generates QR codes for shortened URLs for easy access via mobile devices.\n*   **User-Friendly Interface:**  Provides a clean and intuitive interface for URL shortening.\n*   **API Access:** Offers a RESTful API for programmatic URL shortening and retrieval.\n\n## Screenshots/Demos\n\n*(Placeholder: Insert screenshots or a demo video link here showing the application in action. Example:)*\n\n![](/path/to/screenshot1.png)\n![](/path/to/screenshot2.png)\n\n[Link to Demo Video](https://www.example.com/demo)\n\n## Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/ZaidP101/ReadMePilot\n    cd ReadMePilot\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n\n    *   **Frontend:**\n        ```bash\n        cd UrlShortner\n        npm install\n        ```\n    *   **Backend:**\n        ```bash\n        cd ../server\n        npm install\n        ```\n\n## Configuration\n\n1.  **Environment Variables:**\n\n    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if it doesn't exist - it's listed as a key file so assumed it does exist).  Refer to the provided `.env` file for the required variables.\n    *   Set the following environment variables:\n        *   `PORT`: The port the backend server will run on (e.g., `5000`).\n        *   `MONGO_URI`: The MongoDB connection string (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/urlshortener`). You might need to create a MongoDB database if you do not have one. Set it in `.env` file\n\n2.  **Frontend Configuration:**\n    *  The frontend connects to the backend API.  Ensure the `API_ENDPOINT` in `UrlShortner/src/App.jsx` (or similar file) points to the correct backend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/url/shorten`).\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  **Start the backend server:**\n    ```bash\n    cd server\n    npm start\n    ```\n    (Or use `nodemon` for automatic restarts during development: `npm run dev` - you'll need to check `server/package.json` scripts.)\n\n2.  **Start the frontend development server:**\n    ```bash\n    cd UrlShortner\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n    (This likely uses Vite. If it uses Create React App, the command will be `npm start`.)\n\n3.  **Open the application in your browser:**\n    Visit the URL provided by the frontend development server (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).\n\n4.  **Enter a URL and click \"Shorten URL\".** The application will generate a shortened URL.\n\n## API Reference\n\nThe backend provides a RESTful API for URL shortening and retrieval.\n\n*   **`POST /api/url/shorten`**\n    *   Description: Creates a shortened URL for a given long URL.\n    *   Request Body:\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"longUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/very/long/url\"\n        }\n        ```\n    *   Response:\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"originalUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/very/long/url\",\n            \"shortUrl\": \"http://localhost:5000/XXXXXX\",\n            \"urlCode\": \"XXXXXX\"\n        }\n        ```\n    *   Error Responses:\n        *   `400 Bad Request`:  If the `longUrl` is missing or invalid.\n        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: For unexpected server errors.\n\n*   **`GET /:urlCode`**\n    *   Description: Redirects to the original URL based on the provided `urlCode`.\n    *   Parameters:\n        *   `urlCode`: The unique code associated with the shortened URL.\n    *   Response:\n        *   `302 Found`:  Redirects to the original URL.  (May be 301 depending on implementation.)\n    *   Error Responses:\n        *   `404 Not Found`: If the `urlCode` is not found in the database.\n        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: For unexpected server errors.\n\n## Tests\n\n*(Placeholder: Add information about the project's testing suite, including instructions on how to run the tests.  This project seems to lack formal testing based on the file structure.  If tests exist, modify this section accordingly.)*\n\nNo automated tests are currently implemented in this project. Consider adding unit and integration tests to improve code quality and maintainability.\n\n## Deployment\n\n1.  **Backend Deployment:**\n\n    *   Deploy the Node.js/Express backend to a hosting platform like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Google Cloud Run.\n    *   Configure the environment variables (`PORT`, `MONGO_URI`) on the hosting platform.\n    *   Ensure that the backend server is accessible via a public URL.\n\n2.  **Frontend Deployment:**\n\n    *   Build the React frontend for production:\n        ```bash\n        cd UrlShortner\n        npm run build\n        ```\n    *   Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory (or similar output directory from the build process) to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3.\n    *   Update the `API_ENDPOINT` in the frontend configuration to point to the deployed backend URL.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
